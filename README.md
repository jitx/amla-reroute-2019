# MOTIVE: Micropayments fOr Trusted vehIcular serVicEs

MOTIVE is a framework that can be used to build applications that allow vehicles to exchange payment for data and compute services. It has been developed at the USC Viterbi Center for Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet of Things (CCI) & Autonomous Networks Research Group (ANRG).

## Motivation
Air pollution is on the rise all over the world. The transportation industry is one of the sources of air pollution. Studies indicate that patients with asthma are increasingly visiting hospitals and emergency rooms. One study reports that the insurance companies spend 80 Billion USD between 2008 to 2013 to treat asthma-related problems. Besides, government agencies are also increasing the investment to tackle issues related to climate change.
## Problem
Urban planning and civil engineers propose eco-friendly routing algorithms based on the dynamics of the city, weather patterns, among other things. However, there is no incentives for the drivers to follow eco-friendly routes.
## Solution: ReRoute
ReRoute presents an incentive-driven eco-friendly routing framework to encourage the drivers to follow green routes. Our framework recommends routes' along with incentives or carbon-tokens for each route. Driver selects a route, and if follows the route, the framework rewards the drivers with carbon tokens. 

Drivers can use the carbon tokens to buy fuel including electric charge or use the tokens to reduce the insurance premium or carbon tax. We have developed the framework using Here's routing API, AWS EC2 instance, Ethereum Blockchain and Smart Contracts.
